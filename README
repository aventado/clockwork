This will be the new config giving overall concepts:

IRC server will run on 25% of all bots.  It will allow other nodes to scan for 6667, and happen to hop on and retrieve
addreses to connect to.  This will ensure resilency without requiring domain names, etc...

The IRC algorithm will search using a specific seed from the date, and scan for 6667 in a particular order..
it will connect to the first 5 it finds, and other hosts can do the same.. This means someone would have to shutdown all 5
and considering the IPs are pretty random.. its nearly impossible.

IRC -> botlink -> IRC will be available as well.. IRC will only be used for finding other nodes..
not for command & control.. that will happen on botlink via encrypted etc

IRC an be used to distribute addresses via botlink -> irc

bots with a particular mission or long term goal may modify their ports, encryption keys, etc
and solely rely on their own network to ensure nobody can modify their instructions

bots will perform telnet brute force for routers/IOT.. and connect to a set of crypto currencies

crypto currency protocols can also be another means of hiding communications in..
particular transfers could be distributed across bot link and saved/logged with other information

DNS attack allows killing any set of hostnames across any BIND server by taking advantage of DDoS flood protection and
using it for its own benefit
