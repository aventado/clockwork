the bgp attack is a linux .so module which will modify BGP packets on the fly
to cause issues..

it will be a separately compiled module, and will have a few ways to enable it

1) ptrace
2) LD_PRELOAD
3) ld.so manipulation / library manipulation
4) binary modification / redirection / manipulation

ill probably support half of these..
