irc is widely used with trojans, and worms.. however in a horrible manner

The way I'm going to use irc is a bit more efficient..

IRC will take the current date and use it to generate IP addresses in
a specific order for all bots of the same release..

It will then connect to the first 5-10 servers it finds with 6667 open..
It will join a room generated from this information as well.

The point is not for C&C but rather to find other bots to connect to..
The room will be used to transmit information regarding bots to connect to..

since it connects to multiple servers it gives it some redundancy

It should be practically impossible to stop unless someone literally gets everyone to shut down
open irc servers..

I'll attempt to find a few more protocols that can be used in this same way..

This with other forms of security such as RSA on botlink, etc will literally make it unstoppable,
and anonymous.. without issues of using money, or registering emails/domains
